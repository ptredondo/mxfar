The "mxfar" package equips users with the simulation tools and inference methods for the MXFAR-fPDC framework.

## Installation

You can install the current version of "mxfar" package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ptredondo/mxfar")
```

## Reproducing Key Results of the MXFAR paper
We provide here a drive containing the data, pre-loaded outputs and the R codes to reproduce key results of the paper "Functional-Coefficient Models for Multivariate Time Series in Designed Experiments: with Applications to Brain Signals"

# library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ptredondo/mxfar")
```

## Reproducing Key Results of the MXFAR paper
We provide here a repository containing the EEG data and R codes to reproduce key results of the paper "Functional-Coefficient Models for Multivariate Time Series in Designed Experiments: with Applications to Brain Signals"
